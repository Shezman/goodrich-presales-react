                <h2>Valuation Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                  Teams Chips are valued based on supply and demand as well as
                  expected future performance, the same way the stock market is
                  valued. Chips of teams atop the standings will be more
                  valuable than bottom dwelling teams. By the same token, chips
                  of bottom teams that sign a big time free agent or perform
                  above expectations will tend to increase in value.
                </p>
                <h2>Chips Mechanism</h2>
                <p>
                  Let’s say you are a Lakers fan. You know the team inside and
                  out, and you root for them every chance you get. When the team
                  wins, you’re ecstatic. But wouldn’t it be nice if you won
                  along with the team? Perhaps you are in a fantasy basketball
                  league. You can win some money if your fantasy team performs
                  well, but how many Lakers players are on your fantasy team?
                  And even if your fantasy team performs well, you only get paid
                  once a year when the season ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can also go to Vegas and place a bet on the Lakers to win
                  a specific game. If they win, you win, but if they lose, you
                  lose all of your money. A huge bummer! True, you can bet on
                  the Lakers winning the NBA championship, but you’d have to
                  wait an entire season to collect your winnings, just like in
                  fantasy basketball.
                </p>

                  This is where the Team Chip comes in. When you hold a chip,
                  you can win indefinitely. During the season, your chip value
                  can go up when your team wins. During the offseason, your chip
                  value can go up if the team makes a favorable trade or signs a
                  premium free agent. The value of your chip goes up and down.
                  But unlike fantasy or sports betting, you don’t have to start
                  over after every game or every season. Your chip is yours to
                  keep for as long as you like.
