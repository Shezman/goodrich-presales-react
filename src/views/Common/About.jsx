                    GoodRich is a brand new way for you to win in sports. We are
                    a Sports Investment Exchange that allows you to buy and sell
                    Team Chips of your favorite teams.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As sports fans ourselves, we didn’t find the current
                    offerings on the market all that appealing. We could join a
                    fantasy league once a year, spend all year tweaking a roster
                    of players that we may or may not care about, for the chance
                    to win back our entry fee at the end of the year. The ratio
                    of time we spend on our fantasy league compared to the
                    chance of winning at the end of the year is very low.
                    Alternatively, we can place a bet in Las Vegas or Atlantic
                    City on a particular game. If our team wins the game, we
                    win. But if our team loses, we lose everything. It is a
                    singular moment of excitement or dejection. It just wasn’t
                    fun for us.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We created a cutting-edge category, and it’s called Team
                    Chips.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Holding a chip allows you to participate in your team’s
                    success every single game, and even through the offseason.
                    It’s a continuous process! As long as you hold a chip, you
                    have a chance to win.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Here at GoodRich, we are defined by 4 core value
                    propositions. We want to build a company that upholds these
                    4 pillars of our values as we continue to revolutionize the
                    sports entertainment industry.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="normal-font-w">Sportsmanship</h4>

                  <p>
                    In sports, there are always winners and losers. It’s just
                    the way sports works (yes, even in soccer, there are penalty
                    kick tie breakers to determine champions). But we know
                    winning and losing isn’t finite. As a company that is 100%
                    dedicate to sports, we believe in good sportsmanship as a
                    fundamental value, and we built our company culture to adopt
                    the best of sports culture.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We conduct our business with sportsmanship in mind at every
                    turn. We know how it feels to be on both sides of the
                    ledger, so you will always find us being humble when we win
                    and gracious when we lose. It’s part of our company DNA.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="normal-font-w">Diversity</h4>

                  <p>
                    Sports is the ultimate meritocracy. It has the power to
                    reach across traditional boundaries like race and gender. It
                    doesn’t care what color you are or what class you belong to.
                    Your performance on the court or on the field determines
                    whether you get to play or not.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    At GoodRich, we run our company like how we would run a
                    sports team. Our founding partners come from all kinds of
                    backgrounds and nationalities, and we expect our employees
                    to be the same. We believe that having a diverse group of
                    people that brings different perspectives to the company is
                    an asset, and it is the only way we know we can grow. And
                    more importantly, we believe it is the right thing to do.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="normal-font-w">Unity</h4>

                  <p>
                    In sports, each player contributes a particular skill set to
                    the team. A point guard is different from a power forward,
                    who is different from a center, and a team cannot win
                    without the right combination of assists, rebounds, and
                    blocks that ultimate lead to points on the scoreboard. When
                    players work together towards a common goal, the results are
                    often very beautiful and rewarding. The way Jordan played
                    with Pippen was mesmerizing. The three rings that Kobe and
                    Shaq won together was as beautiful as their eventual divorce
                    when they no longer wanted to work together was ugly. LeBron
                    won two rings with Wade in Miami in four years. When players
                    put their individual strengths together, they were able to
                    win multiple NBA championships as a team.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We also believe that teamwork beats individualism, and we
                    want to cultivate a team-first mentality in our company. Our
                    goal is to assemble the right group of hard-working
                    individuals who can work together in a unified fashion
                    toward a common goal. Then, and only then, will we be
                    successful as a company.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <h4 class="normal-font-w">Excellence</h4>

                  <p>
                    Some players play for the sake of playing, and others play
                    to win. Some are satisfied with sitting on the bench and
                    collecting a paycheck, and others will not rest until they
                    have a ring on their finger.{' '}
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We are in the sports business. We created a whole new way
                    for sports fans to involve themselves in their favorite
                    team’s success. And we didn’t do it for the sake of doing
                    it. We did it to be a successful enterprise that brings a
                    new experience to millions of sports fans worldwide. Simply
                    put, we won’t settle for anything less than excellence. Only
                    with our dedication and determination will we be able to
                    achieve the results we seek.{' '}
